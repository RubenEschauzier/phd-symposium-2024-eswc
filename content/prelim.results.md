## Preliminary Results
{:#PreliminaryResults}

As an early-stage PhD, there are no concrete results to report. 
Initial work was primarily focused on the exploration of the literature around relational database optimization, SPARQL query optimization, caching theory, learned optimization, and more.
Following an extensive literature review, the next step was an exploration of the problem space.
This produced an early-stage visualization tool of how LTQP engines explore the decentralized environments and an in-depth analysis of the document links discovered during query execution [](cite:cites eschauzier2023does).
