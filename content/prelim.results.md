## Preliminary Results
{:#PreliminaryResults}
Initial work was primarily focused on the exploration of the literature around relational database optimization, SPARQL query optimization, caching theory, learned optimization, and more.
Following an extensive literature review, the next step was an exploration of the problem space.
To facilitate understanding of LTQP, I produced an early-stage visualization tool of how LTQP engines explore the decentralized environments and an in-depth analysis of the document links discovered during query execution [](cite:cites eschauzier2023does).
Moreover, I established a software framework to facilitate the subsequent implementation of LTQP optimization algorithms. This was achieved by enabling the engine to associate metadata with each triple processed during query execution.
