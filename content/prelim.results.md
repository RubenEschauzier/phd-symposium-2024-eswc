## Preliminary Results
{:#PreliminaryResults}

As an early stage PhD, there are no concrete results to report. 
Initial work was primarily focussed on the exploration of the litetature around relational database optimziation, SPARQL query optimization, caching theory, learned optimization, and more.
Following an extesnive literature review, the next step was an exploration of the problem space.
This produced an early-stage visaliation tool of how LTQP engines explore the decentralzied environements and an in-depth analysis of the document links discovered during query execution [](cite:cites eschauzier2023does).
